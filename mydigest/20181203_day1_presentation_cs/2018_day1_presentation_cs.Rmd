## Why docker?
- Software needs to interact with other systems ==> DLL-hell in Windows, Libraries in *-ix

- Hence encapsulation is a solution

- Virtual machines as one solution, around for 20 years, but lots of overhead and performance is not like on native installations

- Containers as a further development
    + software and libraries are encapsulated into a container
    + 
    
    
## Getting started with docker

{Break for windows users to get docker installed. }

* Explaination of output from `docker run hello-world`. Basic terms are __docker client__ and __docker daemon__. 


## Docker Client Operations

Getting a list of containers

```{bash}
docker ps -a 
```

A list of images are obtained

```{bash}
docker images
```


## Repository of Images

* Docker-hub at `hub.docker.com`
* Search allows to search for images of a given name, e.g. search for `jupyter`

```{r dockerhub, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path="odg/dockerhub.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/dockerhub.png")
```
 
 
## Running Images as Containers
 
* The command `docker run ubuntu` attempts to run the docker container called `ubuntu`. 
* Showing the list of containers is given by `docker ps -a`
 
 
# Part 2 (Slide 2) : Using JWAS 
 
* Pulling the image 
* Starting 
* The result opened in the browser
 
```{r jupyterstart, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic("odg/jupyterstart.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/jupyterstart.png")
```
 

## Getting Started with Jupyter and Julia
Once the above content appears in the browser, we can get started with `jupyter notebooks`. Some features are explained in the screenshot below

```{r jupyterfeature, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/jupyterfeature.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/jupyterfeature.png")
```

In the note book `firstJuliaNotebook`, some basics about data types are shown and explained. 


## Dataframes
The notebook `notebook_IO_dataFrames` contains an introduction about how to work with dataframes in `Julia`. Dataframes are defined in package `DataFrames`. For reading data the package `DelimitedFiles` is used. Inside this package, the function `readdelim` can be used to read delimited files


## Strings vs. Characters
* Strings are in double-quotes
* Characters are in single-quotes


## Include Julia Into Rmd
According to https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html, it is possible to include other languages into Rmd documents. The package `JuliaCall` (https://non-contradiction.github.io/JuliaCall/) is used for a seamless integration of Julia into Rmarkdown.  The following chunks try to demonstrate that

```{julia}
myAge = 50
myAge
```

The question is what type of variable is `myAge`

```{julia}
typeof(myAge)
```
